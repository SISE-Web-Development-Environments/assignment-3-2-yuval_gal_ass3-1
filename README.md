## API Changes:
1. We replaced the tags to be like the routes we chose: user, profile, recipe.
2. We decided in which endpoints we should use cookies and which dont..
3. We changed some of the end-points return value to make it as the API, and accordingly we changed the examples.
4. We've added more errors detail to the endpoints.
5. We changed the names of the end-points.
