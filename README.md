## The changes we made to previous assignment are:
1. We replaced the tags by the subdivision of the models we chose to make: user, profile, recipe
2. In some endpoints we used cookies and some did not
3. We changed some of the end-points of the return value to make working with the API more convenient, and accordingly we changed the examples
4. We've added some more detail to the endpoints for the errors
5. We changed the names of the end-points
